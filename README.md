# First Person Character Controller

This character controller is inspired by the Source engine and it's heritage
(GoldSrc, Quake, etc.), and has similar features like:
- Crouch jumping
- Air strafing
- Surfing

Currently updated to Godot 4.1.

This version feels a bit strange, surfing doesn't work properly. If you want to
see what the original version was like, go back to commit 6af3ceb (using godot
3). I'll see if I can improve this one though.

Sometimes I just want to open tf2 and jump around, but it often takes 20 to 30
minutes for me to open steam, open tf2, and actually join a server. When I
eventually force myself to work on this, hopefully it can be a replacement for
that.
