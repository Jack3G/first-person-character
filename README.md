# First Person Character Controller

This character controller is inspired by the Source engine and it's heritage
(GoldSrc, Quake, and even Doom), and has similar features like:
- Crouch jumping
- Air strafing
- Surfing (Not yet, but almost)


## Things I might add

### The shooting part
An items/weapons system, projectiles, hitscan, damage types, that sort of thing.

### Multiplayer
A client / server system. Both client and server would be in the same project to
avoid duplicate code and assets, like [this][multiplayer example].
